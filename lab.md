## Git Multi-user Workflow basics.

## Learning Objectives/SWBAT
- Create branches
- Merge Branches
- Navigate Merge conflicts.
- Work remotely

#### Today you will be building a simple app collaboratively. Each person in your group will be responsible for a single function in an app that will randomize the students into groups and save those groups to a text file. You have been given the basic structure of the app as well as a full solution if you get stuck.

#### Your workflow will look like the following:
- One team member will create a repo and give access to it to the rest of the team.
- Each team member will then clone down the repo and create and checkout a new branch with the name of the function they will be working on.
- Each team member will then create their function. Try it out without the starter code but feel free to reference it if you get stuck.
- When you have finished with your function merge your branch with master and push it to github and let your team know.
- Once every one has finished their feature, merged into master and pushed up to github, everyone should pull down master.
- from master, checkout a new branch with your name. Here you will assemble the functions your team has written in a file that you can call with node. There is no solution code for this so each of you will have to write this on your own.
- merge your branch into master and push it to github. If you were first you win! If not it's time to navigate some merge conflicts.
